How can I install it?
============
1) Get the library:

**Download from Github**

        git clone https://github.com/JustinWinthers/angular-webpack-starter.git


2.) Install WebPack globally so you can run the WebPack Dev Server commands

**You'll want to install webpack globally on your system**

```
npm install -i -g webpack
```


3.) install all of the node dependencies

**From the command line type:**

```
npm install
```


4.) start the webpack dev server

**Run the server from the command line by typing:**

```
npm start
```

5.)  Navigate to http://localhost:8080/#/


## For deployments

Type ```webpack``` on the command line to build the bundle.js as the WebPack Dev Server deploys only an in memory
copy of bundle.js that satisfies get requests when running the server.
